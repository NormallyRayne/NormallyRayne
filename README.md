# 👋 Hey, I’m Rick

I’m a **front-end focused developer** with a strong eye for design, a curiosity-driven mindset, and a habit of building things that *actually ship*.

I care about:
- clean UI
- thoughtful UX
- scalable code
- and learning beyond checklists, tests, or titles

> Learning isn’t a ladder — it’s a universe.  
> Curiosity > credentials.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Build modern web apps with **Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript**
- Design interfaces that feel intentional, not accidental
- Turn ideas into working products (not just demos)
- Collaborate remotely with teams and ship production code

I’ve worked in **remote environments**, contributed to real-world codebases, and I’m constantly refining how I think about software — technically *and* philosophically.
